Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
The first part of our project is the gene set enrichment analysis, which we performed on gene expression data from the 1000Genomes dataset and the Hallmark genesets. Our analysis began with the data manipulation, which we performed inside the "GSEA.ipynb" Jupyter notebook. Download the entire repository (including the data files), and then open the notebook and run it. Follow each cell step by step, and by the end, the appropriately formatted data should be located in a new file called "gene_exp_format_common.txt". Download this file locally, as it will be an input into the GSEA software.
Next, install the GSEA software here: https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/downloads.jsp. Follow download instructions, and open the application. Under the 'Load data' tab, upload the gene expression data ("gene_exp_format_common.txt") and the label data ("age.cls"). The gene expression data should be generated by the notebook locally, and age.cls is included in the github. Now, go to the 'Run GSEA' tab, and load the following data: For expression dataset and phenotype labels, upload "gene_exp_format_common.txt" and "age.cls" respectively. For the gene sets database, choose the Hallmark one ("h.all.v2023.2.Hs.symbols.gmt"). After choosing the datasets, click the run button at the bottom right. The results shoudl be displayed on the bottom left of the screen. These results include enrichment scores and charts for each gene set, as well as data for each individual gene.
