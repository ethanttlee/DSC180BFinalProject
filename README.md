Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
The first part of our project is the gene set enrichment analysis, which we performed on gene expression data from the 1000Genomes dataset and the Hallmark genesets. Our analysis began with the data manipulation, which we performed inside the "GSEA.ipynb" Jupyter notebook. Download the entire repository (including the data files), and then open the notebook and run it. Follow each cell step by step, and by the end, the appropriately formatted data should be located in a new file called "gene_exp_format_common.txt". Download this file locally, as it will be an input into the GSEA software.
Next, install the GSEA software here: https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/downloads.jsp. Follow download instructions, and open the application.
